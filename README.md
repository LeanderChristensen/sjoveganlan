A website I made in 2016/17 for the LAN party my class was hosting for our school

Demo link: https://l-c.io/lan

The demo is static (no php) and doesn't 100% reflect the 2016/17 look and behavior.

# About

This was one of the first websites I ever made, and I couldn't have imagined a better first project for learning than this. In retrospect I see that the website wasn't the best looking, but look at the feature list below; it's amazing what I achieved with no experience. Also the launch of the website was without problems, even though hundreds of people visited it.

# Features
- Authentication
- Account page where users can edit every aspect of their account
- Pages with information about the event
- An english version of the site
- Seatmap where users can reserve seats and see which ones are taken
  - When users click on a taken seat, a window pops up that shows the profile of the user
- Crew page where those attending can see the staff so they know who to contact
- Hidden page for crew where they can edit some extra stuff regarding their profile and view a list of every registered user
